// Implement something like Promise.all yourself as a regular function called
// promiseAll.


// I initially tried to use the for index as promise resolution indicator but of
// i is of course already assigned before the promise was resolved and so the
// if clause would often return true too early.
// Took the pending fix from the exercise solution.
