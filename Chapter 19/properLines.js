// Improve the draw tool to make it draw a full line.

// A line between two pixels is a connected chain of pixels, as straight as possible,
// going from the start to the end. Diagonally adjacent pixels count as a connected.
//
// Finally, if we have code that draws a line between two arbitrary points,
// we might as well use it to also define a line tool, which draws a straight line
// between the start and end of a drag.
