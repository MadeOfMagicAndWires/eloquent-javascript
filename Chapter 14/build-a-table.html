<!--
   - Given a data set of mountains,
   - an array of objects with name, height, and place properties,
   - generate the DOM structure for a table that enumerates the objects.
   -
   - It should have one column per key and one row per object,
   - plus a header row with <th> elements at the top, listing the column names.
   -
   - Write this so that the columns are automatically derived from the objects,
   - by taking the property names of the first object in the data.
